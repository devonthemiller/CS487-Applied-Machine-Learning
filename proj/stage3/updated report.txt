Problem:

Our goal is to create a simple movie recommender system using data from the MovieLens
dataset found at: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/. Movie recommenders are used
in many different movie streaming services, such as Netflix and Hulu. Our recommender would
likely be more simple than these implementations. Using the rating data of different movies 
allows us to make informed decisions about what movies should and shouldn't be recommended to
certain users. Additionally, the watching history of users can intelligently inform the recommender
on what movies a user is more likely to enjoy. We will try to get to this stage in our project, but
if we don't then at the very least we will use movie ratings to train our recommender.


Motivation:

Recommender systems of all kinds are tremenedously useful in media-sharing applications, particularly
those which wish to increase the usability and popularity of their services. Since the movie and music
industries are very saturated, recommenders are needed to help users more easily discover media which they
may enjoy.


Proposed Solution: 

A proposed solution is to build a item similarity based recommender system, which will store an index of when two people watch the same movie. When this occurs and depending on the score, the system can recommend an item to the other user because it detects that those two users are similar in terms of the movies they 
watched.
